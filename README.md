# Music Visualiser Project

# Description of the assignment
My assignment is a program that creates a visual piece of art which interacts with music.  The piece of art is not an extemely complex design but goes great and interacts well with certain kinds of music.  The art piece exists of a small sphere at the centre of colour red.  This sphere resemples the core of the art piece.  The sphere gets larger and smaller depending on the amplitude of the music and rotates on its own independenlty.  

Then there is a second sphere holding the smaller sphere of colour green.  This sphere acts as the centre piece of the art piece.  This also gets larger and smaller depending on the amplitude of the music and rotates independently.  There then is an even smaller sphere which orbits around the larger sphere in accordence with a certain mathmatical equation.  This is supposed to resemble an electron orbiting at atom.  All of this is then encapsulated inside a blue pyramid which rotates independenlty switching directions.  The genre of music I feels that goes best with the visual is electronic.  Hence I chose the song Rompasso by Angetenar. 

# Instructions
There is no real complexity to how the art piece works as I wanted to keep it simple as it is designed as something the user can sit back and enjoy rather then interacting with it.    

# How it works
To make it run you simply run the program then when the new window opens up you can either make it full screen or leave it in a smaller window and pess *spacebar* to make the music and visual start playing.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The aspects of the assignment I am most proud of are firstly the orbating sphere.  I am proud of this part of the visual as I created a certain mathmatical equation to make the small sphere travel on a path which I was happy with.  The second part of the assignment that I am happy with is creating the pyramid which encapsulates the visual.  I am proud of this as in processing there is no function to create a pyramid so I had to create it myself using mathmatics.
